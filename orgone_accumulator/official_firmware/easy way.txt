Note, DIY orgones with momentary switches still need to do it the other way for now.

with this hex file you do not need to open arduino, edit overclocking et cetera.

plug the USB cable in to the orgone accumulator (or programmer for retail units)
run teensy loader. (included with teensyduino from PJRC.com if you do not have it)
turn off "auto"
"open hex file" in the file menu of teensy loader
open the hex hex file in this folder
click upload.
after the progress bar is finished, click reboot.
you should see orgone LEDs light up and you are done.
